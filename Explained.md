App Overview: Keyword Proximity Tool for Journalists and Newsrooms

The Keyword Proximity Tool is designed to help journalists, newsrooms, and content strategists analyze relationships between keywords, improve their E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness) for news SEO, and optimize their content strategies. It uses advanced techniques like TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to identify clusters, overlaps, and opportunities within keyword datasets.

What the App Can Do

1. Analyze Keyword Proximity

	•	Computes a cosine similarity matrix between keywords based on TF-IDF scores.
	•	Shows how semantically related keywords are, helping identify clusters and relationships.

2. Heatmap Visualization

	•	Visualizes the relationships between keywords in an intuitive heatmap.
	•	Makes it easy to identify highly related clusters or isolated keywords.

3. Insights Maker

	•	For any selected keyword, highlights the top 5 most related keywords.
	•	Provides actionable insights to improve content coverage for specific topics or events.

4. Keyword Clustering

	•	Groups keywords into clusters based on a similarity threshold (e.g., 0.5, 0.7).
	•	Helps create topic hubs or organized coverage for ongoing news stories.

5. E-E-A-T Recommendations

	•	Provides tailored recommendations to enhance topical authority, trustworthiness, and engagement.
	•	Offers guidelines for avoiding keyword cannibalization and structuring content for Google News SEO.

6. Downloadable Results

	•	Exports the computed proximity matrix as a CSV for external use.

How Journalists and Newsrooms Can Use It

1. Plan Comprehensive News Coverage

	•	Challenge: Covering evolving events (e.g., elections, natural disasters) requires multiple articles targeting diverse aspects.
	•	Solution:
	•	Use keyword clusters to identify unique angles to cover, such as:
	•	“Election 2024 live updates”
	•	“Election analysis”
	•	“State-by-state results”
	•	This ensures each article serves a distinct purpose and avoids overlap.

2. Optimize for Google News SEO

	•	Challenge: Google News prioritizes content that is timely, relevant, and authoritative.
	•	Solution:
	•	Use the heatmap visualization to identify trending clusters or related keywords to target.
	•	For example:
	•	A trending query like “hurricane updates” might highlight related keywords such as:
	•	“Safety tips for hurricanes”
	•	“Government response to hurricanes”
	•	Include related terms in headlines, subheadings, and metadata for better visibility.

3. Strengthen Internal Linking

	•	Challenge: Readers often need contextual background or follow-up information.
	•	Solution:
	•	Use keyword clusters to map out internal linking opportunities.
	•	Example: An article about “AI regulation 2024” can link to:
	•	“Timeline of AI legislation”
	•	“Global impact of AI policies”
	•	This builds authoritativeness and keeps readers engaged.

4. Avoid Keyword Cannibalization

	•	Challenge: Multiple articles targeting the same intent can compete against each other in search rankings.
	•	Solution:
	•	Use the proximity matrix to identify overly similar keywords.
	•	Refocus articles to target distinct user intents. For example:
	•	Article A: “Election 2024 live vote counts.”
	•	Article B: “What election results mean for global markets.”

5. Improve Engagement with Related Articles

	•	Challenge: Keeping readers on-site and exploring additional content.
	•	Solution:
	•	Use the top related keywords for each query to suggest relevant articles.
	•	Example:
	•	A user reading “Economic impact of inflation” could see links like:
	•	“Inflation and its effect on wages”
	•	“How central banks combat inflation.”

6. Adapt to Emerging Trends

	•	Challenge: Quickly covering breaking news or trending topics.
	•	Solution:
	•	Upload real-time Google Search Console data into the app.
	•	Use top matches and clusters to prioritize coverage areas.
	•	Example: For a breaking story about a sports event, identify clusters such as:
	•	“Team standings”
	•	“Top player stats”
	•	“Game schedule”

7. Enhance Trust and Authority (E-E-A-T)

	•	Challenge: Google values topical authority and trustworthiness for news content.
	•	Solution:
	•	Use the tool’s recommendations to structure content hubs around major topics.
	•	Ensure follow-up articles and background pieces interlink to strengthen authority.
	•	Avoid publishing redundant content by analyzing proximity overlaps.

Example Workflow for a Newsroom

Scenario: Covering a National Election

	1.	Upload Keyword Data:
	•	Collect keywords like “election live updates,” “state results,” and “vote counts.”
	•	Upload to the tool for analysis.
	2.	Generate Proximity Insights:
	•	Use the heatmap to identify which keywords are semantically related.
	•	Cluster related keywords like:
	•	Cluster A: “live updates,” “vote counts,” “state-by-state results”
	•	Cluster B: “election analysis,” “impact on economy,” “polling data”
	3.	Content Strategy:
	•	Assign articles for each cluster:
	•	Cluster A: Real-time updates.
	•	Cluster B: Post-event analysis and predictions.
	4.	Optimize for Google News:
	•	Use trending queries for headlines and metadata:
	•	Headline: “Election 2024 Live Updates: Breaking News and Results”
	•	Metadata: “State-by-state results, polling data, and expert analysis.”
	5.	Monitor and Update:
	•	Upload new keyword data weekly to track trends and adapt coverage.
